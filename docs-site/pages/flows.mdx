# Flow Management

Flows group related steps with shared memory and context. They allow complex workflows with long running conversations.

```yaml
flows:
  - flow_id: take_order
    enters: [take_order]
    exits: [finalize_order, end]
    components:
      memory:
        llm:
          provider: openai
          model: gpt-4o-mini
```

Each flow can maintain context, summarize when exiting and transfer knowledge between flows.
