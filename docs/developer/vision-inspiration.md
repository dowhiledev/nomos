# Vision & Inspiration

Nomos aims to provide **structured guidance** for AI behavior. The project name comes from the Greek word for "law" or "custom" and emphasizes ruleâ€‘based flows.

Key features include:

- step based agent flows
- persona driven prompts
- extensible tool integration

These features are highlighted in the main README:

```
- **Step-based agent flows**: Define agent behavior as a sequence of steps, each with its own tools and transitions.
- **Persona-driven**: Easily set the agent's persona for consistent, branded responses.
- **Tool integration**: Register Python functions as tools for the agent to call.
```
