# Vision & Inspiration

Nomos is about giving you **control and observability** over AI agents. Instead of one large prompt, you guide the model through clear steps with explicit tool access. The framework was inspired by our own need to tame prompt-based chaos and build reliable assistants for production use.

Key ideas:

- **Step-based agents** keep behavior predictable and easier to debug.
- **Persona-driven prompts** let you maintain consistent tone and brand voice.
- **Extensible tools** allow safe interaction with your code and thirdâ€‘party services.
- **Flow groups** organize complex conversations with their own memory and metadata.

Nomos draws inspiration from projects like CrewAI and LangChain but focuses on shipping enterprise-ready agents with strong testing and deployment stories.
