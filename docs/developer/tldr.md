# TLDR

A lightning-fast overview of why Nomos matters:

- **Multi-step agents** – break tasks into predictable steps with explicit tool
  access.
- **Flexible workflows** – build in pure Python or use YAML for configuration.
- **Production ready** – tracing, error handling and deep testing are built in.
- **Portable** – run locally, in Docker or on your favourite cloud platform.
