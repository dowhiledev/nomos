# Nomos Developer Documentation

This guide helps you build agents with a smooth developer experience. Choose the workflow that best fits your team:

- **[Fullcode](fullcode/README.md)** – write steps, tools and tests entirely in Python.
- **[Less-code](less-code/README.md)** – describe agents in YAML while keeping tools and deep tests in Python.
- **[No-code](no-code/README.md)** – configure everything in YAML and reuse package tools.
