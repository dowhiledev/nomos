# Nomos Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Nomos developer docs. This section explains how to build and test
your own step‑based agents using different levels of code. Start with a quick
overview and then dive into the workflow that matches your team.

## Choose Your Workflow

- **[Fullcode](fullcode/README.md)** – write steps, tools and tests completely in
  Python.
- **[Less-code](less-code/README.md)** – define agents in YAML while keeping
  tools and deeper tests in Python.
- **[No-code](no-code/README.md)** – configure everything in YAML and reuse
  package tools.
